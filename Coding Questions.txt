Given a matrix consisting of only zeroes and ones.Cell containing 1 is available for connection and cell with 0 is not. The task is to find how many number of unique connections that can be made with adjacent cells (on all 8 sides).

Given a matrix of integers, task is to find out number of positional elements. A positional element is one which is either minimum or maximum in a row or in a column. If there are multiple minimum or maximum elements in a row or a column, return -1.


Encode/Decode the string based on the input. The output should be based on the key. There are following 3 inputs from the user:int (operation o-for encode, 1-for decode)

Find the first non-repeating character in the integer array. This question is similar to the given in geeksforgeeks : First non-repeating character
Initially i solved this question using 2 arrays which has the complexity for O(n^2) but he then told me to simplify then i was able to do so in O(2n). After solving this question i was given another question


Given an string and a burst length , output the string such that count of same adjacent characters in string are less than burst length.

Given an array of distinct integers, output the number of sub-sequences of length 3, either in increasing or decreasing order.

Find the number of positional elements in the given matrix. Return -1 if there is more than one occurrences of any positional element in the corresponding row or column. (This question is same as given on GeeksForGeeks except the condition given for occurrences of positional element : find-number-of-positional-elements)
I was able to solve this using same approach

Given a dictionary of the words(strings) which contains different words & you are given an input string e.g. “abd”. You need to find the largest word available in the supplied dictionary which can be made using the letters of input string. The returned word can contain only the same no of occurrences of the letters as given in the input string i.e. if a letter is given once then in the output it should be existed only once. Examples:
Dictionary {“to”, “banana”, “toe”, “dogs”, “ababcd”, “elephant”} and input string is “eot”. Output should be “toe”
Dictionary is same as specified in example a but the input string is “ogtdes” and the output is “dogs” and “toes”

 Given a matrix of positive integers/points. We have to start from lower left corner and reach the upper right corner. Our path should be such that we fetch maximum points. Only two movements are allowed- up and right, i.e. from a cell (R, C), you can either go to (R, C+1) or (R-1, C).


Given a range of numbers [x, y] and an integer q. Multiply all the numbers in the range by q and return the count of all the numbers which have no same digits as the corresponding product obtained.
Ex- If x=10, y=12, q=2. Then the products corresponding to 10, 11, 12 are 20, 22, 24.
The count will be 1 as only 22 has all different digits than 11.

Then, he asked a question on an array: Given an int array, arrange the elements in increasing decreasing order i.e. one element bigger than a smaller element then bigger and so on.
After I answered this question, he asked me a simple question that suppose 2 people are starting at some point in the circle, first with speed of 4 and second with speed of 6, In how much time they’ll meet again. (Don’t know the motive behind asking so simple question. :P)


Question: Given a remote having 0-9 digits, plus button (to increase channel), minus (to decrease) and previous channel button (to go to the previous channel). We were given 2 numbers stating the start and end channel number and an array having various channel numbers. The task was to go to all channel numbers given in array with a minimum number of clicks.

After that, he gave me a puzzle: Suppose you and I are playing a game on a round table and we both have an infinite number of coins. The rules are as follows:
It is a turn-based game, so you and I take turns alternatively (1 coin per turn)
We have to place the coin on the table and coins cannot be put on top of each other.
Coins may not be moved once put on the table.
if there isn’t any room to put coins on the table, the person who placed the last possible coin wins.
So if I give you the opportunity to go first, which move you’ll start with to ensure victory?
After this, some discussion happened on GS and its workings.

I gave O(n) complexity solution, but the interviewer was not satisfied with it and asked me to implement a balanced binary search tree which I couldn’t.

Given a matrix containing only 0’s and 1’s. Each row will have some number of consecutive 0’s followed by some number of consecutive 1’s. We have to find the row containing maximum 0’s and also the number of 0’s in that row. At first, I suggested implementing Binary Search on every row to find the number of zeroes and then comparing the number of zeroes for every row. The interviewers said it is right but they wanted something better. Then I suggested implementing Binary Search on first row, store the index containing last 0 and then moving down in the matrix on that index. If you encounter a 1, then you can safely ignore that row. If you get a 0, then you can implement Binary Search on that row and update your stored values. The interviewers were satisfied with this solution.
